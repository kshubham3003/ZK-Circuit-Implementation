# ZK-Circuit-Implementation

## Overview

Welcome to the zkSNARK Circuit Design and Deployment project! In this challenge, you will design a zkSNARK circuit, implement it using Circom, compile the circuit to generate intermediaries, generate a proof using specific inputs, and deploy a Solidity verifier contract on Sepolia or the Mumbai Testnet. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, make sure you have the following:

1. Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Access to the Polygon network (either Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet) via a wallet like MetaMask.

## Steps

### 1. Circuit Design

Write the zkSNARK circuit implementation in a file named `circuit.circom`. Define the logical operations and constraints required for your specific use case.

### 2. Circuit Compilation

Compile the circuit using Circom to generate the circuit intermediaries. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g circom
circom circuit.circom -o circuit.json
```

This will produce `circuit.json` and other intermediary files.

### 3. Generate Proof

Use the generated circuit intermediaries to create a proof. Update the inputs in the `input.json` file and run:

```bash
snarkjs wtns calculate circuit.wasm input.json witness.wtns
snarkjs groth16 prove circuit_def.json pk.json witness.wtns proof.json
```

### 4. Deploy Solidity Verifier

Write a Solidity verifier contract (e.g., `Verifier.sol`) that includes the necessary logic to verify proofs. Deploy this contract to Sepolia or the Mumbai Testnet using Remix or Hardhat.

### 5. Verify Proof on-chain

After deploying the verifier contract, call the `verifyProof()` method with the generated proof and inputs. Use a script or Remix to interact with the contract on-chain.

## Testing

1. Ensure the zkSNARK circuit is correctly implemented by running the proof generation process.
2. Deploy the Solidity verifier contract on Sepolia or the Mumbai Testnet.
3. Call the `verifyProof()` method on the verifier contract with the generated proof and inputs.
4. Assert that the output is `true`.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully designed a zkSNARK circuit, compiled it, generated a proof, and deployed a Solidity verifier contract on the Polygon network. This project demonstrates your ability to work with zkSNARKs and deploy secure and verifiable circuits on blockchain networks.
